#Hello, World! in C

###To Compile
  * If you have `gcc` and `Make` on your system, just type `make` in terminal within this directory. If you don't, edit the Makefile or use watever C compiler that you use on your system.
###To run
  * After compiling, if you used the Makefile, there should be a binary file called `hello_c_exec`, or whatever output you used with your compiler. To run it in a UNIX system terminal, prefix it with a `./` like so `./hello_c_exec`, then press ENTER/RETURN. You should see an output of `Hello, World!`.
